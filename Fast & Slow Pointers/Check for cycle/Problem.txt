Problem Statement
Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a function to determine if the LinkedList has a cycle in it or not.

Example:
The following LinkedList has a cycle:
head->1->2->3->4->5->6->3

The following LinkedList doesn't have a cycle:
head->2->4->6->8->10->null

Constraints:
The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
